                            Git is a version control system; you can think of it as a series of snapshots
                            (commits) of your code base. With the creation of each snapshot you build out a whole application,
                            seeing the growth of a full app. during this time you can make branches to experiment and come back to 
                            a previous snapshot you took or merge those experiments into the your app.

                            GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. it lets you and others work togeather

                            or even update our code base with features they wanted to add.
